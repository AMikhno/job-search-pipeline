"""Typed source registry. Sources are Pydantic objects, never YAML.

Companies are NOT hardcoded here; they are loaded from the private
config/companies.csv at runtime (see shared.models.Company). This registry
defines *how* to talk to each ATS, not *which* companies — and it is the single
source of truth for board URL templates (adapters are constructed from it).

`{board_ref}` in a template is the ATS-specific path fragment from the company
list. Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby take a bare token; a future multi-parameter ATS (e.g.
Workday's tenant/instance/site) defines its own template and teaches its adapter
to split the ref.

A source also *builds* its adapter (`build()`), so a new ATS is registered in one
place instead of three: the URL template, the fetch policy (timeouts, per-host
interval) and the constructor call all live on the source object.
