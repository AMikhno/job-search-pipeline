"""Merge a discovery inventory into the master company list.

Staging used to be a bare `cp` over `config/companies.csv`, which was safe only
while the master held nothing the generator could not re-derive. It does now: a
hand-corrected board_ref (a corporate suffix the name alone never yields), a deliberate
`active=false`, a note. Overwriting silently discards exactly the knowledge that
was most expensive to acquire.

The rule is conservative and predictable -- **the master always wins**:

  * a company not in the master is **added** from discovery;
  * a company already in the master **keeps its row**;
  * fields blank in the master and present in discovery are **filled** (this is
    how existing rows acquire a website without touching anything else);
  * a discovery row that disagrees with the master on `source`/`board_ref` is
    **reported as a conflict**, never applied. A conflict is real information --
    the company may have moved ATS -- so it is surfaced for a human rather than
    resolved by a rule that would be wrong half the time.

Companies are keyed by normalized name, which is the identity the list actually
uses -- a parent and a named subsidiary sharing one board are deliberately
separate rows.
